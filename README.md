Reprap Wilson, 3D printer design
Published under GPL v3

This is my reprap printer design, a derivative from Josef Prusa's i3 with the
following goals:

1.  Replace the waterjet metal frame / wooden box frame with an inexpensive
	and rigid frame made from standard 2020 Aluminum Extrusion.

2.  To make the build volume parametric (easy to scale up or down by 50%), with
	a parametric BOM tool (spreedsheet) to assist in part selection.

3.  To simplify construction of the printer by reducing vitamins and including 
    detailed assembly steps as part of the design files.  I've made an effort 
	to reduce the number of unique parts (nuts & bolts) as much as possible.
	I've also incorporated single-piece Y ends that eliminate about 20 more
	hardware items.

The repository has these parts:

1. The STL files needed to build the printer.
2. Documentation section where instructions and parts-list can be found.
3. Some parts have corresponding OpenSCAD models which are kept in the scad 
   folder.
4. Various images of the printer/build process are in the images folder 
   (beneath docs).
