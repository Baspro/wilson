Reprap Wilson, 3D printer design

This is my reprap printer design, shamelessly derived from ideas seen on several other printers, most notably the Prusa i3.  

The main goals of Wilson are:

1. To eliminate the need for a costly waterjet frame, or a difficult to make lasercut wood frame, with no compromise to rigidity and ease of adjustment.
2. To make the build volume parametric (easy to scale up or down by 50%).
3. To simplify construction of the printer by reducing vitamins.
