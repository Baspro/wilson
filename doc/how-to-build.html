<b>1.2</b> Slide a brace support onto each threaded rod. On each side of the supports, put a washer, a nut, another nut and another washer (in that order).<p>
Next, slide two two Y end pieces over the ends of the threaded rods.  Place a washer then nut on each end.

<b>1.3</b> Start at one end and tighten the two nuts against the end so that the threaded rod is flush with the outside of the nut.  Tighten both sides of the first end while everything else is loose along the threaded rods.  Use two wrenches as shown to tighten the nuts against the end until snug (tight, but don't compress enough to deform or break the plastic).
<p>
Place two linear bearings on each Y axis smooth rod.
<p>Next, with the other Y end still loosely attacdhed, place the two Y axis smooth rods across the top and fit into the grooves alontt the top of the ends.  Press down on the ends (not in the middle of the rods!) to seat the rods into the Y ends.   Tighten one corner of the remaining end.  Now take a moment to measure with a ruler between the end posts of the tightened side.  (355mm for reference).   Flip the assembly around and repeat the measurement as you tighten the remaining corner (tighten it just a little first, then measure.  If the distance is a little less than the first side, tighten the inner nut outward toward the outer nut, if the distance is a little more than the first side, then tighten the outer nut toward the inner one.  Try to get the two sides as close to the same distance as possible.  This will help ensure your y axis bearings don't experience any binding forces).  Repeat the measurement on the first side and check that all corners are nice and snug.  Take your time on this step, it may require a couple iterations to get the axis square.

<b>1.4</b> Prep the print bed<p>
While the Y axis assembly is free, it is a good time to prepare the print bed which you will attach later.  <p>

Gather the following materials
<ol>
<li>The Y axis assembly you just completed
<li>The wood print bed support
<li>The heat bed
<li>The four linear bearing holders
<li>Eight miniature zip ties
</ol>
</td><td>

<tr><td>
Place the heat bed circuitboard over the wood bed and mark the four corner locations with a pencil.  <p>
Put the heat bed circuitboard aside and place the four linear bearing holders over the linear bearings along the Y axis rods.<p>
Turn the Y axis assembly over so that the smooth rods (and bearing holders) are against the wood print bed surface.<p>
Align the front edge of the two bearing holders nearest the Y end idler with a line that is 80mm from the front edge of the bed.<p>
Align the back edge of the two bearing holders nearest the Y end motor mount with a line that is approx 10mm from the back edge of the bed.<p>
Mark all the holes for the bearing holders.
</td><td>

</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Remove the wood print bed and drill all the holes you marked with a 5mm drill bit. (You want the holes a little over-sized so that there is some room for the screws to "float" when you attach the bed)<p>
Attach the linear bearing holders to the Y axis linear bearings with zip ties.<p>
Set the prepared wood print bed aside.

<h2>2. Assemble the Frame (part 1)</h2>

<table border="1"><tr><td  valign="top">
<b>2.1	Gather the following parts</b>
<ol>
<li>The two side pieces of 2020 aluminum extrusion (the longer ones, generally)
<li>One of the two horizontal pieces of 2020 aluminum extrusion (the shorter ones, generally)
<li>22 T-slot nuts
<li>14 M5 x 8mm screws
<li>The plastic Z motor holders (2)
<li>The plastic rear frame brackets (2)
</ol>
</td>
<td><img src="images/05.jpg" alt="step2 parts" width="600"></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>2.2</b> Slide 6 T-nuts into one side of the shorter extrusion (this wlll be the bottom piece of the frame).<p>
Turn the extrusion over (being careful not to let the nuts slide out that you just put in) and slide 8 more nuts into the opposite side that you begain with.<p>
Place the two remaining extrusions to the sides of the first, and slide two T nuts into each on the side facing up.<p>
Get the two corner braces and place one over each corner.  Line up the two nuts on each extrusion and attach the braces with a total of 8 M5 screws.  Note that the longer extrusions (the "sides" of the frame) should cover the ends of the bottom extrusion piece.  Leave the screws loose until all 8 are started.  Stand the frame "upright" to ensure the sides are slid down flush with the bottom and alternately tighten until all the screws are tight.<p>
Rotate the frame so the other side is facing you and put it back flat on your work surface.<p>
Slide two more T nuts into each side piece and attach the motor mounts the same way you did the rear brackets, using 6 more M5 screws.  <p>
You should have four T nuts sliding around between the lower corners, which will be used to attach the Y axis to the frame in the next step.<p>

<h2>3. Mount the Y axis to the frame</h2>
<table border="1"><tr><td  valign="top">

3.1	The following parts are used during this step:
	a. The partially-assembled Y axis from step 1.
	b. The partially assembled frame from step 2.
	c. Eight M5 x 8mm screws

</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Tighten the nuts on the first side finger-tight against the frame brace then turn the assembly around and repeat on the other side.  Measure a couple times to make sure the distance from the y motor end to the frame braces is the same on each corner.

Next slide the Y axis assembly left or right along the lower frame extrusion so that there is 50mm from the upright extrusion to the inner edge of the frame brace on the "left" side of the printer (as viewed with the Y axis idler toward you).
</td><td>
<pic>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Tighten the frame braces using 8 M5 screws into the T slot nuts that are alread in the lower frame extrusion.

Finish tightening the nuts of the threaded rod against the braces, double-checking that the distance from the Y end to the braces is the same on each side.  A convenient place to measure this after the nuts are snug is from the inside of the nuts (approx 116mm).

<tr><td>
6.2	Mounting the X axis onto the frame.
<ol>
<li>Attach the two Z axis motors to the motor mounts using four M3 x 10mm screws each.  Place the z axis couplers on each motor shaft.
<li>Press each Z axis smooth rod firmly down into the rod holder of each motor mount, being careful to keep the rods straight up and down to avoid breaking the mounts.
<li>Gently slide the X axis assembly down over the Z axis rods.  If the linear bearings in each X end do not align with the Z axis rods, remove the X axis assembly and gently push/pull the two ends to get the distance right.  The motor end of the X axis assembly should be on your left (with the Y idler end toward you).
<li>Insert two t-slot nuts into both the front and back sides of each end (8 total).  You may want to hold the frame assembly on your lap with the upright extensions horizontally at the point, so that the t slot nuts don't slide down to the botttom of the frame.  If they do, simply place your hands over the tops of the extrusions, keeping the z axis smooth rods supported, and tip the assembly over to slide the nuts back toward the top.
<li>Place the upper frame assembly on the frame.  Fit the tops of the z axis smooth rods into the rod holders.
<li>Secure the top of the frame using 8 M5 x 8mm screws.  Be sure to press the top of the frame down securely onto the vertical extrusions, and then press inward on each top corner to seat the upper extrusion against the sides.  
<li>With the X axis assembly resting at the bottom of the Z axis smooth rods, thread the z axis threaded rods down through the nut in each X end until the threaded rods rest against the Z axis motor shafts.  Tighten the z axis couplers.

<h2>7. Mount X and Y motors</h2>
<table border="1"><tr><td valign="top">

7.1 In addition to the frame from the previous step, you will need:

<ol>
<li>Two NEMA17 stepper motors
<li>Two belt pulleys
<li>The two idler bearings and mounts
<li>Three M3 x 10mm screws
<li>Three M3 x 14mm screws

</tr>
<tr><td>
Mount the motors, the pulleys, the idlers.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
Mount the print bed you prepared earlier to the Y axis bearing holders using Eight M3 x 14mm screws and an equal number of M3 nuts and washers.  The washer should go on the screw first, which should go downward through the wood print bed and bearing holder, and secured with a nut.  Attach each screw only loosely first, then check that the bed slides smoothly back and forth along the Y axis.  Tighten the nuts a little at a time until secure.
