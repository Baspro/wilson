Reprap Wilson Extruder files 
----------------------------

The Extruder files, including the X carriage, came originally from the Prusa i3 Rework by eMotion-Tech

Those works are in turn derived from earlier designs by ch1t0, afaik.

I have modified the body of the extruder to translate the motor 5MM toward -X to accomodate the herringbone gears, which I generated from a modified version of the herringbone script by ScribbleJ.
