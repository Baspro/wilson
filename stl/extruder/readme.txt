Reprap Wilson Extruder files 
----------------------------

The extruder files located here are for the direct-drive extruder that I designed for Wilson.  

The parts for the original geared extruder have been moved to stl/alts.

NOTE!  The default direct-drive extruder is expecting you to use 1.75mm filament.  If you are going to use 3mm filament, I recommend building the geared extruder instead.
